We successfully implemented our entire proposed functionality from Part 1 of the the project. We created a database of Columbia Bathrooms (seeking further bathroom additions) in which users can login to our website, write a review of bathrooms, search bathrooms by attributes, and read bathroom reviews from other users. We also included our feeling lucky button that provides the user with a random bathroom as we considered doing in our Part 1 proposal. We also added a leaderboard of the most prominent bathroom reviews to create competition among users. \

Our main page contains a raw SQL entry text-box, this is for testing purposes only and should not be considered as part of our design because all other functionality is present on other pages. Our most interesting pages from an SQL perspective would be our find page, which uses drop down boxes to allow users to enter valid SQL requests and find any of our visible bathrooms that they would like. Because buildings within our system have variable floor names, our dropdown boxes are populated by additional queries to find valid floors. Our review page is equally interesting as it allows users to enter bathrooms along with a review. We made sure to restrict users to entering data with dropdown boxes yet again with the addition of a text field to write their review which is then formatted and added to the database.
